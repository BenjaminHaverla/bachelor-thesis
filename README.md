## Introducing the team
Filmmaking is a team work. And that's the reason why I'm thankful to:
- Nataša Strelová –> because she's a perfect animator and she has an interesting art style and she's participating in this project.
- Oto Haverla (Father) –> he's a perfect music composer and he really has cinematic soundtracks and musics.
- Mr. Mužila –> because his voice matches to this music video and thanks to him we were able to create this project.
