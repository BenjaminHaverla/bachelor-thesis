## Introducing the team
Filmmaking is a team work. And that's the reason why I'm thankful to:
- **`Nataša Strelová`** –> because she's a perfect animator and she has an interesting art style and she's participating in this project.
- **`Oto Haverla (Father)`** –> he's a perfect music composer and he really has cinematic soundtracks and musics.
- **`Mr. Mužila`** –> because his voice matches to this music video and thanks to him we were able to create this project.

I've decided that this Bachelor's Thesis will be a team effort. As I mentioned, filmmaking is collaborative, and I believe in the power of teamwork. Everyone has unique talents, and while I excel in certain aspects of animation and visual effects as a student, I recognize that I'm not skilled in every area. By bringing together individuals with diverse talents, we can create something truly unique, which is the goal of our Bachelor's Thesis.

So generally, our Bachelor's Thesis has two parts: 
- The Theoretical Part
- The Practical Part. 


In the theoretical part, I will talk about the history of the animation, and also I will mention principles of the animation and animation techniques. Of course I know that we have a lot of sources about the history of animation but my goal is to mention



## The Theoretical Part
In the theoretical part, I will discuss the history of animation and also I will mention the principles of animation and animation techniques. Of course, I know that we have a lot of sources about the history of animation but my goal is to mention the important parts that, thanks to them, you can realize the numerous variations of how you can create your own animated project. Through the theoretical part I believe students or people who are passionate about animation, they can realize that there are a lot of options of how you can create your own animation. Also, the goal of this Bachelor's Thesis is to apply some principles of animation into our project.

## The Practical Part

In the practical part, I will explain the whole process of how we tried to apply these principles but mainly how we worked together and what should be the result and what is the result. You know... now I'm going to talk mainly about the practical part and what is important to mention is the PATH...

### Why we choose to create animated music video?

In our University as a Bachelor's Thesis, we have to create animated short film with a length of at least three minutes. You know... I was asking myself: 

"okay which story I should tell to the world and connect it with the Bachelor's Thesis?!"

And I felt again it should be LOVE. We can see nowadays that we have a lot of struggles. Mainly I feel it from the news. There's a lot of wars... 

And I'm trying with this animated project to be a mirror of our society. And yes, it's true, I created a short film about love in 2021, but I grew up and I feel that I have again a little bit new perspective about the love. 

And why animated music video? You know, I felt that I needed to put a lot of emotions about love and a lot of let's say information so I felt that with a music video you can tell a lot of emotions in a short time and If it's going to be connected with the animation it can be really interesting.

So Then I was wondering which people I should use for this animation or ask for help... that's better I think because that was the truth... Ask for help and I found these three amazing people and we officially done one minute but there are three minutes in front of us so we will see how it will go.

But thanks to them I believe we can create something unique. You know, in the practical part, I'm explaining also the practical process and there is some useful information. For example, how we saved time. I mean... okay... first I'm going to explain the process. We created music and according to the music we are doing animation and this can save you a lot of time because it's really hard to make animation, especially when it's hand-drawn animation. In our case, this is digitally hand-drawn animation. And imagine that you worked a lot of hours, a lot of days on the drawings, and then for example the music duration is going to change because we're still not ready with the music. Then you have to do it all again, and you lost so many hours!

So what is much more better in our situation? In our case, the solution was to create first music and we said okay this is the official duration of the music and let's say official also emotions from the music let's work on the animation... 

And this saved our time! 

And yeah I was working on the storyboard after the music one month and then I showed the storyboard to the animator and what is interesting is... that this project is about teamwork. Because she disagreed with some things that I showed in the storyboard and you can see right here the example that in my vision there was one butterfly but at the end, we used more butterflies or for example, the hand was using also the fire but at the end you can see the visual is a little bit different.

You know the meaning is the same but we did some small changes. But I feel it's much more better. So it's good to have different point of view and as a director of some of your projects, you need to feel the balance. I mean which opinion is navigating you in the right way and which opinion is going to navigate you in the wrong way... So there's a lot in front of us, I mean we have still three minutes that we need to fill in our music video. 

Well, I wish you also a Bachelor's Thesis and a lot of good things in your life and I hope that after some time, you can see this animated music video on my website. My plan is for this music video to be on the Filmfreeray website where I have my own profile and you can see there my other projects.

So I hope your goals will be also successful, I wish you a lot of luck in your Bachelor's Thesis and in your life, and have a nice day! Goodbye!
