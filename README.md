## Introducing the team
Filmmaking is a team work. And that's the reason why I'm thankful to:
- Nataša Strelová –> because she's a perfect animator and she has an interesting art style and she's participating in this project.
- Oto Haverla (Father) –> he's a perfect music composer and he really has cinematic soundtracks and musics.
- Mr. Mužila –> because his voice matches to this music video and thanks to him we were able to create this project.

I've decided that this Bachelor's Thesis will be a team effort. As I mentioned, filmmaking is collaborative, and I believe in the power of teamwork. Everyone has unique talents, and while I excel in certain aspects of animation and visual effects as a student, I recognize that I'm not skilled in every area. By bringing together individuals with diverse talents, we can create something truly unique, which is the goal of our Bachelor's Thesis.

So generally our Bachelor's Thesis has two parts, and that's the theoretical part and the practical part. In the theoretical part, I will talk about the history of the animation, and also I will mention principles of the animation,

So generally, our Bachelor's Thesis has two parts:
